# Project 2 - Wordle

Submitted by: Hector Baeza

Wordle is an app that replicates the popular game "Wordle". In the game you must guess a word. You input letters to guess and if the letter is highlited then it is a hint to guess which word it is.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [X] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [X] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [X] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

This week went better than last week. I found the hints to be much more helpful this week. 
I had to brush up on Type Casting and the different types available. Unfortunitley I did not have enough time to complete the optional features.
